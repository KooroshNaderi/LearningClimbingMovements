IMPORTANT INFO:

The project works with Visual Studio 2017.

The Visual studio project does not maintain all the commands when transferred. To get the project working, You must change the target platform version to your Windows version. To do that, go to each project's Properties -> Configuration Properties -> General -> Target Platform Version, and change the version to your Windows version. We used Windows 10.0.15063.0.

The main file handling everything is "LearningClimbingMovements.cpp".
